# Bookstore app with MERN stack

I started a tutorial to learn MERN stack and build an app with it.
You can access the tutorial I followed during this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA

# What I learned during this project:
1-) Write post and get server with javascript
2-) Used Postman to test server
3-) Used MongoDB and connected the app to MongoDB
