# Bookstore app with MERN stack

I started a tutorial to learn MERN stack and build an app with it.
You can access the tutorial I followed during this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA

# What I learned during this project:
1) Created http server with JS.
2) Used Postman to test server
3) Used MongoDB and connected the app to MongoDB
4) Used Routes for http handling.
5) Used JSX for frontend.
6) Used Axios for managing http tx.
